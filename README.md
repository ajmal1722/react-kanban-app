# React Kanban App

Developed a Kanban application to help users organize tasks and manage workflows efficiently using a visual board with draggable elements. This project was built with modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
- Task Management: Create, edit, delete, and manage tasks with ease. Tasks can be assigned to different columns representing various stages of a workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
- Drag and Drop Interface: Integrated react-beautiful-dnd for an intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to move tasks between columns easily.
- State Management: Utilized Redux Toolkit for managing the application state, ensuring a robust and scalable state management solution.
- Persistent State: Implemented redux-persist to persist the Redux store across sessions, ensuring that user data remains intact even after page reloads.
- Notifications: Used react-hot-toast to display real-time notifications for task actions like creation, updates, and deletions.
- Responsive Design: Ensured the application is fully responsive and works well across different devices and screen sizes.
